Population Change Forecasting

 Overview
This repository contains a project aimed at forecasting population changes. The analysis uses historical data to understand and predict future population trends. The primary focus is on the population changes in California, covering various components such as births, deaths, and overall population growth.

 Repository Structure
- notebooks/: Jupyter notebooks for data analysis and forecasting.
- data/: Contains the datasets used for the analysis.
- models/: Saved models and scripts for forecasting population changes.
- README.md: Project overview and instructions.

 Data
The primary dataset used in this project is PEA15.20231014T151028.csv, which includes the following columns:
- STATISTIC Label: Description of the statistic being measured.
- Year: The year of the recorded statistic.
- Component: The specific component of population change (e.g., births, deaths).
- UNIT: The unit of measurement (e.g., thousands).
- VALUE: The recorded value of the statistic.

 Data Source
The data was sourced from 
- CSO.ie, (2022). PEA15 - Annual Population Change. https://www.cso.ie/en/PEA15.
- Data.gov.ie, (2022). HPA13 - Residential Property Price Index. https://www.tradingeconomics.com/ireland/residential-property-prices.

 Installation
To run the notebooks and scripts in this repository, you need to have Python installed. 

 Usage
 Jupyter Notebooks
The primary analysis and forecasting are performed in Jupyter notebooks. You can start Jupyter Notebook by running:

bash
jupyter notebook


Open the notebook Population_Change_Forecasting_CA.ipynb to explore the data analysis and forecasting steps.

 Scripts
For running the scripts directly, use:

bash
python scripts/population_forecasting.py


 Analysis and Forecasting
 Data Exploration
The initial steps involve loading the dataset and exploring its structure. Key steps include:
- Understanding the distribution of population change components.
- Visualizing historical trends.
- Identifying patterns and anomalies.

 Forecasting Models
The project employs various forecasting models to predict population changes:
- Time Series Analysis
- ARIMA Models
- Machine Learning Models

 Results
The results of the analysis and forecasting are documented in the notebooks. Key findings include:
- Trends in birth and death rates.
- Predicted population growth for the next decades.
